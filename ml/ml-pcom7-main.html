						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
						This module introduces machine learning. A field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building
						systems that can learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Throughout the course, we encountered numerous challenges and engaged in a variety of practical exercises and tasks.
						<br>
						<br>
						This hands-on course provided valuable learning experiences through independent research, teamwork, and the 
						development of multiple models, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms as well as
						artificial neural networks.
						<br>
						<br>
						Machine learning is a vast field, and i recognize that there is still much to learn. However, this course gave me
						a strong foundation and a practical understanding of key concepts.
						<br>
						<br>
						Going beyond theoretical knowledge, we explored how artificial neural networks function, discussed the 
						legal and ethical implications of machine learning, and exmained its future applications.
