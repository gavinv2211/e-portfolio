						<h2>Discussion 2 - Legal and Ethical views on ANN Applications</h2>
						<p>
						This discussion continues from the discussion in Unit 8 "The risks and benefits of the use of AI writers at different level, from administrative work to creative writing".
						Summary and peer resonses.
						<br>
						<br>
						While the use of AI writers does offer major benefits, they also carry notable risks. Martyna Antas points 
						out an important concern regarding uncritical acceptance of AI-generated content which can lead to the 
						spread of misinformation if users don't assess the information critically. 
						The article by (Monteith et al., 2023) addresses the growing use of generative AI highlight both its 
						benefits and risks. The spread of misinformation from generative AI is a key concern particularly in 
						mental illnesses.
						<br>
						<br>
						James Adams expanded by mentioning that organizations may need to adapt their training and development 
						strategies due to technological advancements, also highlighting concerns that junior employees might miss 
						out on traditional learning opportunities due to a reduction in roles, while senior employees must 
						continuously update their skills to remain competitive. James referred to the article 
						by (Boritz et al., 2023) which represents an alternative perspective - if technology is properly 
						leveraged, it can enhance skills, experience and cognitive abilities rather than diminishing them.
						<br>
						<br>
						In summary, generative AI has both advantages and disadvantages. It is crucial to recognize that 
						generative AI is not perfect, as it can produce misinformation and potentially negatively impact our 
						cognitive functions. However, when used correctly and with an awareness of its limitations, it can be 
						beneficial too.
