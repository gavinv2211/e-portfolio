						<b>The Wall Article</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						The article by Wall (2019) focuses on Facial Recognition technology which is increasingly being adopted by police 
						and security forces globally to identify criminals and terrorists by scanning faces in crowds and matching them against 
						databases of known individuals.
						<br>
						<br>
						A research report by (Rainie et al., 2022) examines the thoughts and perspectives of Americans on 
						the widespread use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies. 
						The study reveals that while a majority of the public believes this technology can assist in finding 
						missing persons and solving crimes, many also express concerns about its potential misuse. 
						Specifically, there is a belief that police may use facial recognition to track individuals' 
						locations and disproportionately surveil Black and Hispanic communities.
						<br>
						<br>
						If one has nothing to hide. Why is this a concern?
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Potential misuse or errors.</b> The assumption is that these surveillance systems are used only for 
						   legitimate purposes. These systems are not perfect and may lead to wrongful identification or 
						   reflect biases.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Security Risks.</b> The cameras are part of interconnected systems. 
						   Attacks on these networks could result in serious consequences, such as identity theft, 
						   stalking or framing of innocent people.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Loss of Privacy.</b> The loss of privacy can create a society where individuals constantly feel 
						   monitored, leading to an uncomfortable feeling on freedom and expression.

						<b>The CNN model - Object Recognition</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						The notebook uses the very popular CIFAR-10 dataset from Keras. 
						The dataset consists of 60 000 color images containing 10 different object classes using a convolution 
						neural network to classify the images. The dataset is split into 50 000 training images and 10 000 test 
						images.
						<br>
						<br>
						The network contains two convolutional layers, each with filter values of 32. Increasing the filter value 
						on the second layer may increase accuracy. The model does not contain any regularization techniques such as 
						dropout or data augmentation to prevent overfitting, by increasing the filter value on the second layer 
						causes the number of parameters to increase, making the model prone to overfitting. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The model is set to stop training after 25 epochs, early stopping with a patience value of 2 is also 
						applied, when the run the notebook was executed, training stopped after 7 epochs with a test accuracy of 
						71% and a validation accuracy of 63% on my machine. 
						Increasing the filter value on the second convolutional layer gradually may increase accuracy and 
						adding dropout between each of these layers will also reduce the risk of overfitting.
