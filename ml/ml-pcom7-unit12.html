						The course provided a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end process of building machine learning models. 
						<br>
						<br>
						In the first part of the course, I learned about exploratory data analysis (EDA), a crucial step in data 
						science and machine learning. EDA focuses on understanding the data before making any assumptions, 
						identifying obvious errors, detecting outliers, and uncovering patterns and relationships among features. 
						EDA to me is like a science on its own. It is where we get a sense of the data, sparking innovative ideas 
						for problem-solving or identifying opportunities, even without a specific problem to address.
						<br>
						<br>
						As we progressed, we were introduced to statistical methods and supervised machine learning, including correlation and 
						regression. Correlation is purely statistical but by understanding it helps machine learning by identifying relationships 
						between independent variables and the dependent variable, which can guide feature selection and engineering.  Regression is a 
						statistical and machine learning technique used for predictive modelling where the goal is to predict continuous values.
						<br>
						<br>
						We delved into artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Both are types 
						of neural networks, but we learned about their distinct purposes, structures, and how they process data 
						differently.
						<br>
						<br>
						The final part of the course, focused on model selection and evaluation, which provided valuable insights into 
						the approaches and techniques used to choose the most suitable models for specific tasks, as well as different 
						methods used for evaluating and improving model performance.
						<br>
						<br>
						I believe that artificial neural networks and deep learning represent the future of technology, but they donâ€™t excite me right 
						now. I am more drawn to traditional machine learning methods and would like to explore them more, gaining a deep understanding 
						of how they work, their underlying assumptions and the scenarios where they are most effective.
						<br>
						<br>
						Machine learning is the career path I am working towards. I have a strong passion for research, 
						development and data, I believe that machine learning aligns perfectly with this interest. To steer my 
						career in this direction, I need to focus on learning as much as I can and continue building a strong 
						portfolio to showcase my skills and expertise.
