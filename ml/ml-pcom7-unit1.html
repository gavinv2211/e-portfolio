						<h2>Discussion 1 - The 4th Industrial Revolution</h2>
						<p>
							The impact of industry 4.0 after reading the article from Schwab 2016 from World Economic Forum.
						<br>
						<br>
						Klaus Schwab’s 2016 paper discusses how the current wave of technological advancements is transforming industries, economies and societies at an unprecedented rate. In his paper, Schwab makes several compelling observations, those that stand out:
						<br>
						<br>
						“The speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent” (Schwab. 2016).
						<br>
						<br>
						“In the future, talent, more than capital, will represent the critical factor of production” (Schwab. 2016).
						<br>
						<br>
						In 2012, Knight Capital, a major American trading firm, suffered a catastrophic software error when an engineer accidentally manually deployed a test algorithm into production. 
						This error triggered a flood of unintended stock trades within 45 minutes. According to (Dolfing, 2019), this incident cost the company $440 million, and ultimately Knight Capital was bought out by its rival Getco LLC. 
						Although none of Knight Capital’s clients were financially impacted by the errant trades, the company’s share price dropped by 63% just two days after the glitch (Popper, 2012). 
						This led to significant losses for shareholder and likely resulted in job losses within the company.
						<br>
						<br>
						Klaus Schwab’s framework sheds light on the risks and vulnerabilities exposed by incidents such as the 2012 Knight Capital error. 
						The paper emphasizes that the unprecedented speed and scope of technological advancement bring both transformative potential and significant challenges. 
						Knight Capital’s error emphasizes Schwab's assertion that skilled talent, not just capital, is crucial in managing complex technological systems. 
						In high-stakes environments like finance, even minor errors in automated systems can rapidly escalate, leading to severe financial losses. 
						This incident highlights the importance of rigorous testing, oversight, and human expertise to ensure technology is deployed safely and effectively in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
