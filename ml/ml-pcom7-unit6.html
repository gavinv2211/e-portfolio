						<h2>Seminar 4 - K-Means Clustering</h2>
						<p>
						Using the iris.csv dataset from UCI Machine Learning, perform K-means clustering, using 3 clusters 
						<br>
						<br>
						K-means clustering is a simple and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. A cluster refers to a collection of datapoints
						aggregated together, based on certain similarities, K refers to the number of cetroids to be used in the dataset (Education Ecosystem, 2018). A centroid is a location
						representing the center of a cluster (Education Ecosystem, 2018). Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance method.
						Since there are 4 features in the Iris Dataset, each data point is represented as a 4-dimensional
						space.

						<b>Team Assignment: Airbnb business analysis using a data science approach</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						In the team assignment, we were tasked with developing a report addressing a business analytics question 
						using a data science approach. The dataset used is the Airbnb 2019 dataset from Kaggle. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The team consisted of three members from different parts of the world, which made the time zone differences a bit challenging, 
						however we managed this well. Throughout the project, we had only one Teams meeting, during which we proposed and agreed 
						on the business analytics question to focus on. We then broke the project into different tasks, with each team member 
						indicating which tasks they were particularly interested in doing. Any unassigned tasks were delegated as we progressed 
						through the assignment. We all agreed on timelines when a specific task needs to be completed for the other team member to 
						take over. All other communication took place via email. We didnâ€™t designate a team lead, as we felt all team members 
						were mature enough to handle their tasks independently, working towards a shared goal.
						<br>
						<br>
						Since I had the most experience with python and working with data, my role was to perform the technical 
						tasks such as writing the python code to perform the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building the 
						clustering machine learning model. Another team member was responsible for creating the report as she had 
						a background in academic writing. The other team member was responsible for detailing the methodologies used, 
						co-ordinating tasks and revising and submitting the final assignment pack.
						<br>
						<br>
						Although we faced some challenges, I believe we worked very well together. 
						Each team member brought unique skills to the table, creating a well-rounded team. 
						I believe this diversity in skills and perspectives was key to our success and ultimately 
						helped us achieve a distinction on the assignment.
