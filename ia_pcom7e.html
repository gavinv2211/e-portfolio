						<h2>The Rise of Agent Based Systems</h2>
						<p>The development of agent-based systems was influenced by key trends and developments in computing. According to (Wooldridge, 2009) 
							the five trends that contributed to the rise of agent-based systems are: Ubiquity, InterConnection, Intelligence, 
							Delegation and Human Orientation. Ubiquity and interconnection refers to the increasing presence of computing devices 
							and the widespread interconnection between these systems. Agent-based systems offer a flexible approach to managing the 
							complexity and scale of distributed environments by efficiently handling interactions and processes. 
							Intelligence provides for intelligent behaviour, by helping to make decisions based on the environment 
							and adapt to changing conditions. Delegation focuses on reducing human intervention by handling specific tasks and processes 
							independently. Human intervention aims at making interactions more intuitive by allowing humans to engage with the system 
							more naturally through negotiating and communicating with agents which understands and responds to the userâ€™s needs.
						<br>
						<br>
							Agent based simulation is a modelling technique that uses autonomous agents to explore the dynamics of complex systems. 
							Over the last two decades, agent-based simulation has developed into a significant research and management framework 
							within organizational theory (Gomez-Cruz et al., 2017). It offers a comprehensive framework that facilitates detailed 
							descriptions, explanations, predictions and insights about organizations and their processes (Gomez-Cruz et al., 2017). 
							Additionally, it aids in the creation of tools used to enhance operational decision-making and problem-solving.
