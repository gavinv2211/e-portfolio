						<br>
						Predicting football match outcomes using traditional machine learning models 
						in comparison to deep learning models.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Significance:</b>
						<br>
						Explain reasoning behind choosing traditional machine learning. 
						Including Interpretability, computational efficiency and practical use.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Research Question:</b>
						<br>
						- What features are most significant to predict match outcomes?
						<br>
						- How do traditional models compare in accuracy against more complex models?
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Aims and Objectives:</b>
						<br>
						To demonstrate that traditional machine learning models remain relevant.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Objectives</b>
						<br>
						- Evaluate the significance of traditional ML.
						<br>
						- Compare tradition ML and deep learning models.
						<br>
						- Practical benefits of traditional ML.
						<br>
						- Assess real-time applicability.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Key Literature:</b>
						<br>
						Consider books online journals and existing models for traditional ML in sports prediction, 
						Feature selection & Model Interpretability, Computational efficiency and real-time learning.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Strategy and Research Design:</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Development Strategy</b>
						<br>
						- Literature Review.
						<br>
						- Data Collection.
						<br>
						- Develop and Experiment.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Research Design</b>
						<br>
						- Methodology.
						<br>
						- Analysis Techniques.
						<br>
						- Expected Outcomes.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Ethical Considerations:</b>
						<br>
						- Does my data contain any personally identifiable information. If so is required?
						<br>
						- Being aware of Bias machine learning and how to overcome/test for bias.
						<br>
						- What will the research by used for?
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Risk Assessment:</b>
						<br>
						Create a table assessing the different risks, their likelihood of happening and how the risk will be
						mitigated.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Timelines:</b>
						<br>
						- Timelines, how long will it take me to complete the research project?
						<br>
						- Consider planning and literature review, data preparation, model development (traditional ML & deep learning),
						report writing and final review.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
						Reflection
						</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						Creating project outline a week or so before starting your project helps you prepare effectively. 
						It gives you some time to consider how you plan on tackling the tasks, how much time each task will take, 
						and what resources you will need. This phase allows you to identify potential challenges and allocate 
						time for research and consultation if needed. Having a clear outline makes it easier to stay organized, 
						track progress and ensure all requirements are met.
