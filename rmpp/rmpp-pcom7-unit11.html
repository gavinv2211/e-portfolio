						Unit 11 focused on professional development planning. It included the creation of a SWOT analysis,
						an Action Plan, and a Skills Matrix. These documents were designed to support self-assessment and helps
						to identify strenghts, weaknesses, opportunities and threats related to career development

						Reflection
						</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						Reflecting on the professional development unit. It became clear that the experience pushed well beyond 
						my comfort zone. It encouraged some reflection not only on the course, but also in my professional career 
						and broader professional journey. The last time I completed a SWOT analysis, may have been as far back as 
						high school, making this a valuable exercise in revisiting personal and professional direction. 
						<br>
						<br>
						This unit forced some critical thinking about future aspirations. Completing this master’s degree, 
						to me is not only about obtaining the certificate, the goal is to actively apply the qualification in 
						a meaningful role such as a machine learning engineer. While a lot was learned during the course, it is 
						clear that a qualification alone is not enough to secure a role in the field. Continuous development 
						alongside a structured action plan, will be essential to achieving that goal. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The formatives within this unit, particularly the SWOT analysis and skills matrix has been instrumental 
						in forming a clear roadmap for future growth. The SWOT analysis highlighted curiosity as a key strength, 
						but it also revealed how this same trait can become a weakness when it leads to frequent distractions and 
						the urge to jump into new areas before fully mastering current ones. 
						<br>
						<br>
						This experience prompted me to explore frameworks in education and professional development that support self-paced learning, 
						with the aim of developing effective self-regulated learning strategies such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, and reflective 
						evaluation. Carneiro et al. (2019) highlights, we live in a society where lifelong learning is becoming increasingly 
						important. With more learning taking place in informal, less instructor-led environments, the ability to self-direct and 
						regulate one’s own learning is becoming a critical skill. Many self-regulated learning models have been developed. 
						Zimmerman (1989) developed a model aimed at improving the performance of self-regulated learning, a cycle which consists of 
						four steps (1) self-evaluation and monitoring, (2) goal setting and strategic planning, (3) strategy implementation and 
						monitoring and (4) strategic outcome monitoring. Perhaps following one of these models is something 
						to consider for future self learning goals.
