						In units 7, 8 & 9 key statistical techniques for Hypothesis testing and data summarization were explored.
						Various T-tests were applied including:
						<br>
						T-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means, T-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances & F-Test: Two-Sample for Variances
						<br>
						<br>
						See below worksheets for Exercises and findings

						Reflection
						</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						The statistical and Data analysis and Visualisation units was enjoyable units. The units challenged you to 
						not only perform statistical calculations, but also too actually look at the data and interpret your 
						findings. The T-test is a great calculation to use when you want to compare the means of two groups, 
						often used for hypothesis testing (Bevans, 2023). If you enjoy working with numbers and data, it is 
						essential to learn and understand statistics, as the ability to apply statistical methods is crucial for 
						analysing and interpreting information effectively. Regardless of the industry, statistics help individuals 
						solve problems, it offers insight and support in any situation where relevant data can be collected, 
						analysed and interpreted (MichiganTech, N.D). 
						<br>
						<br>
						Sometimes in courses, you learn a lot about a specific subject. Although a wide range of topics was 
						covered in the statistics units, the exercises were short and to the point. Summary measures such as the
						mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range are tools that everyone can use in their daily 
						lives. Most of us have used the mean before, we just know it as the average. Since the exercises were 
						short, they allowed you to learn a little at a time, but what you did learn really stuck with you.
						<br>
						<br>
						The visualization units helped with presenting and visualizing data; it helped with understanding when 
						to use what graph. Most of us have used excel graphs before and then we use the 3D graphs because it 
						looked visually appealing, instead, as we have learned graphs should be designed to be easily 
						understandable and informative, not to be visually appealing.
