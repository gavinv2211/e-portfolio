						2018 Cambridge Analytica Scandal
					    </b>
						<br>
						The 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal was a major data privacy and political manipulation controversy 
						involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica used personal data of millions of 
						Facebook users without their consent for political advertising, raising concerns about data privacy, 
						election interference and the power of social media in shaping political opinion. The controversy profoundly 
						impacted the world of data privacy, political campaigning and social media (Harbath & Fernekes, 2023). 
						One of the major consequences was the tightening of data privacy laws, including GDPR which was enforced in the EU in 2018, 
						giving users more control over their data and requiring company to more transparent 
						about data collection (Harbath & Fernekes, 2023) 
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
						2016 Facebook Research App.
						</b>
						<br>
						In 2019, Apple revoked Facebook’s access to its Enterprise Developer Program, which allows companies to 
						distribute internal apps to employees using an Enterprise Developer Certificate (EDC) (Matsakis, 2019). 
						Due to Apple’s strict privacy policies on the App Store, Facebook was unable to distribute its Research 
						App publicly. Instead, it exploited the EDC to distribute the app to non-employees, specifically targeting 
						teens and young adults (Matsakis, 2019). Facebook paid users as young as 13 up to 20$ per month to install 
						the app and allow full access to their data. The app collected data such as private messages from social 
						media apps, browsing history, App usage patterns and encrypted data including bank transactions and 
						private chats.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
						Ethical Impact
						</b>
						<br>
						Facebook paid users to install the app without clearly communicating the extent of the data being collected.
					    <br>
						Users were unaware that the app would monitor all online activity including private messages and encrypted 
						data.
						<br>
                        Facebook was already involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which raises questions about its 
						commitment to user privacy, the incident also reinforced the perception that Facebook prioritizes data 
						collection over ethical responsibility.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
						Social Impact
						</b>
						<br>
						Raised awareness about how companies bypass app store policies to track user data.
						<br>
						Apple took a strong stance by revoking access disrupting Facebook’s internal operations. 
						It also escalated tensions between Apple and Facebook.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
		    			Legal Impact
						</b>
						<br>
						The scandal added more pressure on governments to tighten data private laws.
						<br>
						The GDPR strengthened rules on informed consent and data processing.
