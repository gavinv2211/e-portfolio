						Ricardo works for the records department where he has access to files of property tax records. 
						A researcher named Beth has access to numerical portion of the data but requires personal information 
						such as names and addresses of certain parties to contact these parties for more information.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
						If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?
					    </b>
						<br>
						Since Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, he should not release the names and 
						addresses of parties as this data is regarded as personal identifiable information. Instead, he should 
						consult the company’s data protection officer for approval.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
						Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues 
						would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?
						</b>
						<br>
						Before granting Beth access, Ricardo needs to ensure he has the consent of the individuals to share their 
						information for research. He must also verify that Beth has a legitimate need for the data and will 
						handle it responsibly. As stated by (Bos, 2020), Beth, as the researcher, must ensure than any information 
						obtained from or shared by human subjects respects their dignity and autonomy and does not violate the 
						interests of individuals.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
						Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release 
						individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?
						</b>
						<br>
						Beth should be allowed to contact individuals involved, because she needs to brief all individuals on the 
						goal and purpose of the research (Bos, 2020), all participants retain the right to withdraw their 
						cooperation at any time even after the study has been completed (Bos, 2020). Beth needs to ensure that all 
						participants remain anonymous. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>
						Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving 
						permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least 
						one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?
						</b>
						<br>
						All individuals need to give permission to Beth to use their information for research, if she only has 
						permission from one-third, she will need to contact the non-respondents again to obtain permission or 
						contact different individuals.The researcher must obtain informed consent from all participants for all 
						research activities. This consent should specify the data being collected, how it will be stored, and with 
						whom it may be shared. The researcher must then use the data strictly in accordance with the given 
						consent (gov.uk, 2018).
