						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Focus, Aim and Audience:</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Focus – </b>The review will focus on using <b>traditional</b> machine learning models
						to predict sports results – specifically team sports (Rugby and Football). The aim is to identify 
						which features are most important and how they vary between the sports.
						<br>
						<b>Audience – </b>The audience include data professionals with a keen interest in sports data, 
						people betting on sports and bookmakers.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Significance:</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Need and Significance – </b>As data become more accessible, predictive models are becoming increasingly 
						complex. While many studies focus on developing sophisticated models, fewer analyse which features 
						contribute most to accurate predictions. Additionally, different team sports require different features 
						for reliable forecasting.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Context and Perspective:</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Context – </b>The review is situated in the field of sports analytics and machine learning, focusing on 
						predicting the outcomes on team sports using traditional machine learning methods. There is a gap in the 
						literature regarding which features are most important and different features are used for different team 
						sports.
						<br>
						<b>Prespective – </b>For data professionals it will provide guidance on feature selection. For sports 
						bettors and bookmakers, it will offer insights into how machine learning models compare with bookmaker 
						odds and whether certain features can provide an edge in forecasting results.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Framework:</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Feature selection and importance – </b>Review of studies analysing which features impact 
						predictions the most. Comparison of feature importance across different sports.
						<br>
						<b>Comparison of alternative approaches – </b>How machine learning models compare to bookmaker odds. 
						Identifying if there are any limitations to using traditional machine learning compared to deep learning 
						approaches.

						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Strenths and limitations:</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Strengths</b>
						<br>
						There is a clear focus on Traditional machine learning models.
						<br>
						The review captures the diversity in predictive features across different team sports, highlighting 
						how models need to be tailored to specific sports.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Limitations</b>
						<br>
						By focusing on traditional machine learning techniques, the review may overlook more accurate techniques 
						such as deep learning which have shown promise in sports prediction. The literature may not fully address 
						the impact of data quality and availability which can affect model performance
						<br>
						<br>
						<b style="font-size: 24px;">Conclusions and Outcome:</b>
						<br>
						The literature confirms that traditional machine learning models are still relevant for predicting sports 
						results. Traditional machine learning techniques can offer a valuable alternative to more complex 
						approaches like deep learning. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Too many features are available for sport predictions, while additional data may improve predictions, 
						irrelevant or redundant features can introduce noise and decreased interpretability. Feature selection is 
						important for accurate model development. Different team sports require different features for accurate 
						predictability.
						<br>

						Reflection	
						</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						Creating a project outline is a great way to start a report writing project. 
						Dawson (2015) highlights two main approaches people tend to use when writing reports: the top-down 
						approach and the evolutionary delivery. The top-down approach follows a chapter breakdown structure, 
						how many chapters there will be, what each chapter should contain and how each chapter will be broken 
						down into subsections. The evolutionary style starts with writing down parts of the report and then 
						rewriting them as the report evolves. The evolutionary delivery styles is something worthwhile 
						considering using in the research project of the MSc. Dawson (2015) suggests this method lets 
						you write a report over a much longer period of time throughout your project, instead of writing 
						the report at the end of the project. This I believe will make the writing of the report much easier, 
						especially if the report should contain 13 000 words.
