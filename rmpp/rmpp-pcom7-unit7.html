						<b>Initial Post (Unit 7)</b>

						Abi, a researcher or research consultant, has been assigned to evaluate the nutritional value of a 
						new cereal. Based on his initial findings, he cannot confirm that the cereal is nutritious; in fact, 
						his research suggests it may even be harmful.
						<br>
						<br>
						Where did Abi obtain his information? Did he consult a nutritionist with domain-specific expertise? 
						If so, he should submit his findings to the manufacturer, who will then decide whether to publicize the report. 
						Given the negative results, the company is likely to respond with questions, giving Abi the opportunity to present 
						his findings. At this stage, he should have sufficient evidence to prove his conclusions to the manufacturer and 
						should not suggest alternative methods to change the outcome as this is unethical. Defying research ethics would 
						undermine the credibility of Abi’s work, making it difficult for others to trust his methods and findings 
						(Bhandari, 2024). Maintaining ethical standards ensures the integrity of his research and reinforces confidence in 
						his conclusions.
						<br>
						<br>
						If the company chooses not to publish Abi’s findings and instead seek another researcher to produce 
						alternative results, it is Abi’s ethical duty to report this to the relevant legal or regulatory authority. 
						Doing so upholds research integrity, ensures consumer safety, and prevents potential misinformation, 
						especially since this directly impacts public health. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The faulty filter unjustly blocked legitimate information on topics such as gay and lesbian marriage, 
						vaccination, and climate change violating the BCS’s code of conduct principle, “You make IT for everyone”. 
						This principle states that activities should be carried out without discrimination of sexual orientation, 
						religion, or age and that equal access to the benefits of IT should be actively promoted (BCS, 2022).

						<b>Summary (Unit 9)</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						In my initial post, I highlighted the importance of consulting a domain expert, such as a nutritionist, 
						to assist Abi with his research. The feedback from my peers reinforced this idea, as they all agreed that 
						seeking guidance from experts is a valuable approach when conducting research. I would like to 
						reiterate that consulting domain experts—who possess specialized knowledge and experience in a particular 
						field—can provide critical insights, validate research findings, and ensure that the study is based on 
						accurate and credible information. Their expertise can help refine research questions, interpret data 
						effectively, and avoid common pitfalls, ultimately leading to more robust and reliable conclusions.
						<br>
						<br>
						Additionally, I argued that Abi should not include his alternative findings in his report. However, 
						upon further reflection, this argument could be reconsidered, provided that Abi's alternative findings, 
						particularly those related to other correlations, remain ethical and are presented transparently. 
						Feedback from other peers suggested that Abi should not exclude his alternative finding from his reports, 
						as including both positive and negative results is essential for presenting a balanced and transparent 
						analysis. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The paper by (Song et al., 2013) emphasizes the importance of publishing both positive and negative 
						results in research reports. It highlights how the scientific community can prevent skewed interpretations 
						and promote a more accurate understanding of the subject matter by ensuring transparency and comprehensive 
						reporting of all findings.

						Reflection
						</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						The study outlines a scenario involving Abi, a researcher who has been assigned a project to review the 
						nutritional value of a cereal. Abi’s analysis indicates that the cereal is not particularly nutritious. 
						However, he is also able to highlight certain correlations that could portray the cereal in a more 
						favourable light. Some of his peers believe Abi should present both sets of findings to the company, 
						while others argue he should only report his original conclusion—that the cereal lacks nutritional 
						value.
						<br>
						<br>
						Notably, the article does not clarify who commissioned the review or the purpose behind it. This lack of 
						context creates a challenge in forming a well-founded opinion about what Abi should do. Before reaching 
						any conclusions or assigning blame, it is essential to take a step back and gather all the relevant 
						information. For instance, was the review requested by the cereal manufacturer, a regulatory body, or 
						an independent third party? Understanding the 'who' and 'why' behind the project is critical for making 
						an informed and ethical recommendation.
						<br>
						<br>
						In situations like these, jumping to conclusions without the full picture can lead to poor decisions. 
						By ensuring we have all the facts, we put ourselves in a better position to evaluate Abi’s situation 
						fairly and to suggest responsible, transparent actions moving forward.
