						<b>Initial Post (Unit 1)</b>
						<br>
						A chosen case study provided by the Association of Computing Machinery.
						<br>
						<br>
						The chosen case study “Malicious Inputs to Content filters” (ACM, N.D.). Examines the ethical challenges 
						faced by the developers of Blocker plus, an automated internet content filter created to comply with 
						the U.S. Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA). Initially the software was designed with a centrally 
						controlled blacklist that was maintained by the creators of Blocker plus. Due to the challenges of 
						manually updating the blacklist, the creators begun to implement machine learning techniques to automate 
						the identification of inappropriate content. 
						<br>
						<br>
						User feedback was leveraged to automate the identification of inappropriate content and enhance model 
						efficiency. However, activist groups exploited this feedback mechanism by submitting malicious inputs, 
						causing the system to incorrectly classify and block legitimate content. The developers failed to 
						implement safeguards against intentional misuse, violating Principle 2.5 of the ACM code of ethics. 
						Which stipulates that in systems where future risks cannot be accurately predicted, frequent reassessment 
						of risks should be conducted, or the system should not be deployed (ACM, 2018). Furthermore, the 
						developers did not disclose the system’s limitations to the public, violating Principle 2.7 which states 
						that the limitations, vulnerabilities and significant issues of computer systems should be communicated to 
						the public clearly and respectfully (ACM, 2018).
						<br>
						<br>
						The faulty filter unjustly blocked legitimate information on topics such as gay and lesbian marriage, 
						vaccination, and climate change violating the BCS’s code of conduct principle, “You make IT for everyone”. 
						This principle states that activities should be carried out without discrimination of sexual orientation, 
						religion, or age and that equal access to the benefits of IT should be actively promoted (BCS, 2022).

						<b>Summary (Unit 3)</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						The chosen case study “Malicious Inputs to Content filters” (ACM, N.D.), discussed how the developers of Blocker Plus failed to 
						fulfil their ethical obligations as outlined in the ACM code of ethics and BCS code of conduct. The discussion highlights 
						specific ACM principles that were violated and identifies key BCS code of conduct principles that were disregarded.
						<br>
						<br>
						While the post could have considered how developers could have avoided violating principles by following 
						the principles of section 2 in the ACM code of ethics which outlines specific considerations of 
						professional responsibility, I do believe that ethical responsibility should not fall solely on the 
						technical professionals who developed the software. Instead, the company as a whole must be held 
						accountable.
						<br>
						<br>
						Section 3 of the ACM Code of Ethics emphasizes the role of leadership in upholding ethical standards. 
						While these principles apply to computing professionals, leadership has a crucial responsibility to uphold, 
						promote and enforce ethical practices across the organization (ACM, 2018).
						<br>
						<br>
						Furthermore, principle 3.1 states that leaders must ensure the well-being of all individuals affected by 
						computing including customers and colleagues (ACM, 2018). This reinforces that ethical responsibility 
						extends beyond developers to company leadership, who also failed to adhere to ACM principles.
						Ensuring ethical compliance is not just a technical obligation, but an organizational commitment that must 
						be embedded in the company and in its decision-making.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Reflection</b>
						<br>
						Discussing the challenges faced by developers offers a practical approach to exploring and sharing ideas around
						ethical behavior in the workplace. It encourages you to put yourself in the developer's position, reflecting crically
						how you might respond to ethical dilemmas in a professional setting. As professionals, we sometimes focus solely on 
						completing tasks which was assigned to us. However, we all share a responsibility to act ethically and speak up when 
						necessary. Ethical awareness shouldn’t be limited to leadership, every professional should be familiar with and guided by 
						the relevant code of ethics.
